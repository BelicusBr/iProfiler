# iProfiler

Hi,

This is a little profiling tools to help in monitoring some of the main stats in your game on different devices without the need to always connect to profile.

![alt tag](https://s30.postimg.org/6s86yeyq9/iprofiler.png)

- StatsMan
Its a script that you just put on your camera and will show you
  - Current FPS and frame time
  - Average FPS
  - GPU Memory Usage
  - Total Allocated Memory
  - Total Reserved Memory
  - Total UnusedReserved Memory
  For editor mode only It will show  DrawCalls , used texture memory , renderedTextureCount
  
  Its test on Android And IOS.
  
  Note :
  All this stats you can easily get if you run the profiler on your target device
  But i wanted a faster way to always have the most important stats (Actually this is the only stats unity can provide on mobile devices xD ) on my screen without the need to connect the profiler everytime and also needles to say the overhead that a companies connecting with the profiler on older devices so its faster to have the stats this way.
  
  How to use :
  - Just add the script "Statsman" to your camera
  
  - There's a unity package you can just import it in your projects , or just copy statsman script (its just one script in the end xD)

I'm glad to have any suggestions or comments on the scipt or any guide to get more stats from unity.
